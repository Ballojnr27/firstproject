Respnsive Web Design: In this certification, you will learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
First, you will build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you will learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and the best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you will learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen size by building a Twitter card with Flexbox and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.
